This project is a template for implementing various machine learning algorithms using Python. The aim of the project is to provide a starting point for beginners to implement and experiment with different machine learning algorithms on their own data.

## Installation

To run this project, you need to have Python 3 installed on your system along with the following libraries:

* pandas
* numpy
* scikit-learn
* seaborn
* matplotlib

You can install these libraries using pip. For example:

```
pip install pandas
```

## Usage

The project contains separate Python files for each machine learning algorithm such as Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, Random Forest, etc. Each file contains the implementation of the corresponding algorithm along with sample code to load data, split data, train the model, make predictions, and evaluate the model.

To use a particular machine learning algorithm, simply import the corresponding Python file into your project and modify the sample code to load your own data and perform the necessary operations.

The data used for machine learning can be found in the `data` folder. It contains various CSV files that can be used for training and testing machine learning models.
